there are separate widget for get ios features in flutter
    MaterialApp -> CupertinoApp
    Scaffold -> CupertinoPageScaffold

dart final objects actually contain pointer to that object so we can not re initiate that final variable
but we can modify that accordingly
for example we can add new elements to final list (user_transaction file _addTransaction method)


ListView = SingleChildScrollView + Column
