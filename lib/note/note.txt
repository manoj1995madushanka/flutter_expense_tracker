there are separate widget for get ios features in flutter
    MaterialApp -> CupertinoApp
    Scaffold -> CupertinoPageScaffold

dart final objects actually contain pointer to that object so we can not re initiate that final variable
but we can modify that accordingly
for example we can add new elements to final list (user_transaction file _addTransaction method)


ListView = SingleChildScrollView + Column

when we call MediaQuery it is also rebuild the widget as a build method.

const variable initialize compile time and final variables initialize run time

widget tree is full of immutable objects

we can skip unnecessary rebuilds after adding const in front of widget

all stateless widgets are immutable
